CSCS 531 RPS Tournament

This is the setup for the University of Michigan Complex Systems 531 
Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) tournament.  This repository is meant to be a simple
(and somewhat sloppy) implementation of a base RPS Player, a Referee who
runs the mechanics of RPS tournaments, and a driver for the overall tournament.

The goal is to build out a few different tournament types and metarules, as
well as the basics of handling a bunch of student submissions for Player
agents.
